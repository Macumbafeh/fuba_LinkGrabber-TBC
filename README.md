# fuba_LinkGrabber-TBC
This AddOn is a Backport or rather a Re-Write of the AddOn **Wowhead Link Grabber** and **Wowhead Link** but for TBC
Mostly this AddOn is used for Information and Development of other AddOns.  
This AddOn **Requires** [Compatibility-Addon-for-TBC](https://github.com/fuba82/Compatibility-Addon-for-TBC) to work!  

### This AddOn allows you to Grab Database-Link(s) form:
* Buffs / Debuffs
* Quests
* Items
* Spells
* NPCs
* and more...

### Currently i use the Following Databases for this AddOn:
* enUS: https://tbc-twinhead.twinstar.cz
* deDE: https://tbcdb.rising-gods.de

But you can easy edit this by just replace "linkURL" in the code if you want.
